# CryptoConverter
 A basic real-bitcoin converter

About:

The project is a currency converter from real (BRL) to bitcoin (BTC) at the value quoted on November 2, 2021, at 12:59.
The development of this project has the didactic purpose of putting into practice acquired knowledge about programming logic and javascript language.

How to use:

It must be run through a browser, through the Developer Tools, where the code must be entered, followed by the use of the "enter" key. When doing this, the browser will display a window requesting the value in BRL that you want to convert, to later return the value in BTC to the user.
